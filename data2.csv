"Its very difficult to incorporate old business with new business. People go to an app or website, see a bunch of listings, and pick one to buy. Only ways you can really incorporate the human aspect is in your descriptions where you can paint a story on why they should buy, or customer service. Customer service is almost unheard of with modern business, but I think its key to really stand out. The difficulty is in the scale. Old business was more local while new business is global. You could receive millions of questions and its just impossible to answer them all",0.00068,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014
"Its only impossible when you view customer service as an afterthought. Outsourcing this relationship to a call center in Asia is a like drinking poison when youre sick to hopefully make you better. Relationships at scale is possible when you effectively communicate that as the most important part to your team. Thanks for the comment, I think youre right on the local vs global part. And also I agree certain things should be automated, but then you should use all the time youve saved on the getting a customer to transact, and use it to develop a relationship.

"Alex was doing the same as most give, give, give, then ask. Thats how he ran his first business which he wrote the gym secrete books to get people into the door. Now he is looking at a different target audience: successful startups at $3m who want to scale up. So now he gives free info to help you get to the $3m mark and then partners with you to get a percentage. You covered the overall idea of how he got the idea. This is right out of the business of the 21st-century book. So basically building a portfolio of high-income businesses that the owners get to run themselves. Almost like shark tank but more subtle.

This is something I learned from Gary V specifically through his first books and paradoxically he is known more for promoting hustle culture.

"Hey, random question are you into sales or marketing ?

Great video BTW",0.00074,0.00011,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00013
"Apply for a distributer or setter role, which are always in abundance. There are many entry sales roles, in fact most sales companies force each person to start at the bottom so they can teach their own system of selling. Go start selling telecom products or financial products as there are always jobs for those. I also think it is better to start door-to-door as well as it builds grit faster vs doing solely calls. Another advantage for door-to-door is that, if youre good at it, it is much easier to sell and close vs soley outbound phone.",0.00071,0.00012,0.00017,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014

"Awesome video man! I think one other thing to point out is the business model and the outcome of that business model for what he‚Äôs doing now. I say that because he‚Äôs built out multiple successful companies where there was taking and giving because he had to sell to people. Not saying he still didn‚Äôt over deliver.But compared to what he‚Äôs doing now where he‚Äôs financially setup from those previous businesses he can just give give give without having to take at all or worry about finances. And then also considering that he‚Äôs giving everything away because he‚Äôs looking for people to build businesses worth 3-5M per year to make them a 10M per year business. All in all, what you‚Äôre saying is totally right as he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to that point without doing what you talked about in the video. Just wanted to add context from that perspective since it couldn‚Äôt have always been all about 100% giving without taking because it takes money to be in a position to do this very unique thing he‚Äôs doing now. Which he worked his ass off for and deserves every bit of it.",0.03373,0.00079,0.04319,0.00038,0.00402,0.00058

"I find it concerning that this video is promoting the idea that success in business is all about networking and building close relationships, and that old business principles are still the most valuable. While it may be true that these factors play a role in achieving success, its important to acknowledge that the business landscape has changed dramatically in recent years due to the internet and technology. The rise of data-driven businesses and the emphasis on customer experience have upended many traditional business models, and its no longer enough to rely solely on relationships and old-school tactics. Additionally, the suggestion that people are the key to success in business oversimplifies the complex dynamics of the modern workplace and ignores the role of systemic issues like discrimination and inequality. While learning from experienced individuals can certainly provide valuable information, we also need to be open to new ideas and approaches that challenge traditional ways of thinking. Overall, I think this video perpetuates a narrow and outdated view of business success, and we need to be more inclusive and forward-thinking in our approach to entrepreneurship.",0.00057,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014,0.00018,0.00015
"@Peter MacDonald I appreciate your perspective on the importance of treating customers, employees, partners, and competitors as people rather than just means to an end. However, I think its important to recognize that data can actually be a tool for promoting equity and combating discrimination. Data can reveal patterns of bias and inequality in hiring, promotions, and pay, and can help organizations make more informed decisions to create more equitable and inclusive workplaces. Of course, data alone cannot solve societal issues like racism and sexism, but it can be a powerful tool when used in conjunction with a people-focused approach. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between data-driven decision making and a human-centered approach to business. Great video!",0.00058,0.00013,0.00018,0.00013,0.00018,0.00014
"I think what you‚Äôve said is totally legitimate and the majority of companies starting today take your approach. With that said, my video is about not throwing out something just because we have something new, innovation doesn‚Äôt = better, unless it actually is better.

I think when we walk away from that principle business becomes a very dangerous place. Wouldn‚Äôt you agree that when we stop seeing customers, employees, partners, and competitors as people is when we have the most issues with racism, sexism, or discrimination? You‚Äôre not wrong to think the way you do, I would just challenge the idea that data is going to be the salvation to societal issues like this.",0.00084,0.00011,0.00017,0.00011,0.00017,0.00015

"Have you asked him why he lies about using steroids? He wrote a very embarrassing post that he put on 40 pounds of lean muscle in one month by eating carbs. There are lots of guys who use steroids to build a life of lies on top of. When you see a guy in his 20s with an impossibly muscular physique who is making very loud and unproven claims its easy for a naive person to be captivated. For decades people thought Arnold Schwarzenegger was a natural bodybuilder. Ask yourself; if Arnold weighed 150 pounds would he have the hundreds of millions he has today? No, no one would have been interested in him at all. Perception is reality to naive people. And its very easy to lie and cheat your way into being perceived as something you are not.

@Peter MacDonald but its not like people are interested in the alternatives. . and instead will actively deny them. . youtube is a site built to foster opposing narratives. . . so certain individuals can continue to get paid off of the division. . as one whos been sharing the alternatives for literally 20 years. . i can see for a fact that humanity isnt interested in solutions. . only in maintaining there crabs in a barrel mentality by fighting to own each other.,0.00111,0.0001,0.00018,0.00011,0.00018,0.00015
@Peter MacDonald the correlation is that human society is based on and built from layers of controlled opposition. . which if you know what it is then you know why the race to out earn each other simply maintains imbalance and corruption.,0.00084,0.00011,0.00016,0.00012,0.00018,0.00015
